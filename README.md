# TESLA V1 WEBSITE CLONE

This is my submission for the Tesla website clone project as done by Dr. Sahand Ghavidel in his Udemy course - 2 TailwindCSS projects (Instagram & Tesla).

I won the course during his 5 days on Twitter giveaways. The course took a practical approach by diving right into using TailwindCSS to build amazing UIs from the start. Unlike other similar courses that would spend over 60% of the course materials explaining unnecessary details and making it harder to understand.

The goal was simple. At the end of the course, one should be able to build any kind of website using TailwindCSS.

This course made it easy to learn TailwindCSS.

This is v1 as I plan to rebuild the website to reflect the current Tesla website. I did some code refactoring in this version, but hope to have a cleaner code in v2.
